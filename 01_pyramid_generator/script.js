//A pyramid generator is a program where you can set the type of character, 
//the count for the pyramid, and the direction of the pyramid. 
//The program will then generate a pyramid based on those inputs.

//console.log(character);

// step 13
//let profession = "teacher";
//let age;
//console.log(profession);
//console.log(age);

//step 14
